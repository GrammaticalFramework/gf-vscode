# Grammatical Framework language support for Visual Studio Code

Adds syntax highlighting to Grammatical Framework (.gf) files for Visual Studio Code. See [here](http://www.grammaticalframework.org) for details about GF.

The extension is entirely based on John Camilleri's [extension for Atom](https://github.com/johnjcamilleri/language-gf).
